### Impact

### Scalability

### Innovation / Competitor analysis
* Metamask, MetaCert, Google Safe Browsing, Ethereum phishing detector.
* All these solutions are URL-based / centralized.
* Our solution is based on certificates.
* Operates at a lower level. Deeper protection.

### Next steps

### How is key revocation handled ?
* CA revokes key. Revoked on blockchain. No grade required.
* Essentially becomes a ledger of revoked keys

### Difference from PGP
* PGP requires users to build a web-of-trust network
* Our solution does not. Ours is a blockchain counterpart to same problem.

### Difference from Ethereum Phishing Detector / MetaMask
* Is centralized. Single point of failure.
* Is URL based. Our solution is based on certificates. 
* Lower level. Protects against DNS hijacking.

### Difference from MetaCert
* MetaCert is based on URLs.
* Ours is based on certificates.
* Our solution is implemented at a lowerlevel and can also protect against DNS hijacking.

### Difference from Google Safe Browsing
* Centralized - requires trust in Google.
* Is URL based
